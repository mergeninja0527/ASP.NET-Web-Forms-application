       strength is providing a very hands-on level of service while assisting associations in preserving, maintaining, protecting and

       Our team comprehends the complexities of association management. Whether we are assisting an association on a multi-million dollar
       renovation project or simply handling routine service requests, we have the tools and expertise to do it. Managing a Common
       Interest Development takes a village and teamwork and that's what we are all about.

       technology to maintain the highest level of efficiency possible is utilized. This technology allows us to give our clients
       up to the minute responses to their questions. We focus on timely reporting and accuracy in the reports that are provided
       each month. This partnership adheres to the General Accepted Accounting Principals (GAAP), which has it own set of higher
       standards for quality assurance.

       <span style="font-weight:bold">Consulting Management</span> <br /><br />
       There are communities that are self-managed and need some assistance. There are communities who have decided they would like to
       have more control but are not ready to take on self-management. Other communities are looking for ways to better use their
       community funds and would like to look at alternatives to a full service association manager.
       <br />
       <br />
       We offer management consulting services to both condominimum and planned development communities who are seeking a
       different type of service.
